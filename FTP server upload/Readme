This code is based on the MKRGSM FTP library: https://github.com/tryhus/MKRGSM/tree/feature/ftp

An Arduino MKR GSM 1400 with a SIM card with internet is needed for this project.

The program reads 2 analog values and with a time stamp creates a string with a fixed format MMDDYYhhmmssAAAABBBB every second (this can be changed in line 239). 
The string may be "compressed" to reduce data traffic, changing the number's base, from decimal to other base like hexadecimal or base 36 (using 0-9...A-Z). The latter will reduce the Max number of 12319923595999999999 (20 char) to DDDDTTTTAAAAAAAA ( 14 char -30%). Convert Dat, time and analog values before, adding a '1' as he MSD to keep the structure.
i.e. Date: 1123199 -> change base / Time: 1235959 ->change base / Values: 199999999 -> change base
A code will be run on the PC the decode the strings back to their decimal values.

Then a .txt file with name MMDDYYhh ( or MMDDYYhhmm if files are created every less than an hour) is uploaded (streamed) to an FTP server.

At the beginning of the program the user is required to enter through the serial monitor the time size of samples that each file has.
i.e. if 60 is entered, a file will be created every 60 seconds, containing 60 strings with the predefined format. 900 for a file every 15 minutes and so on.

Then set the date and time to start the RTC.

Along the process the uploading progress will be shown in %.

If the process needs to be stoped, type "stop" to the serial monitor. The uploading process will finish once the current file is uploaded.

04132012.txt is a sample file created for a 15 minutes period for each file.
